# Auto-Image-Resizer
Ever wanted to post a collection of vertical and horizontal images to a social network? You may have noticed that some limit the aspect ratio, which in turn can crop out important parts of your images! I've created a handy little python script to solve this issue! Provide a directory of images, a preferred pixel resolution, and the script will create and save new, resized versions of your images! All resulting photos are placed in front of a square, white background, so there is no more undesirable cropping!
